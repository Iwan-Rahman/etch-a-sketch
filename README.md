# etch-a-sketch
About.
Etch-A-Sketch Project allowing to draw in any colour, in cuztomizable grids going up to 100 X 100. The project also has different themes with colourful ui and fun background music.

Bugs.
If the user clicks and drags from an already colored region, they will colour any of the other grids if they hover over them, regardless if the mouse button is held down or not. This can be remdied by simply clicking the mouse again and triggering the mouse-up event listener.

Ideas.
It might be interesting have a feature that allows the user to take a snapshot of the canvas and save it directly from the website.
